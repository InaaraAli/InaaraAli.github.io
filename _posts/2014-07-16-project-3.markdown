  <h4>About</h4> <div style="text-align:left"><p>I pitched a sustainable start-up idea named <i>Descorn</i> in a team for the <i>Emory HackATL</i> business competition.<i>Descorn</i> combines "design" with "corn." Our mission statement was to create a line of sustainable clothing out of a fine fabric derived from corn to tackle the issues of toxic waste generation from the fashion industry and the problem of overproduction of corn in the country.
