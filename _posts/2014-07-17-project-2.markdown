  <h4>Abstract</h4> <div style="text-align:left"><p>

  Countries’ government spending on education differs in various percentages of their GDPs, and
  affects students variously. But, we don’t have an explicit model for relating government
  spending on education to school enrollment and academic performance. Therefore, we are
  analyzing primary, secondary, and tertiary school enrollment levels as well as academic
  performance from the 2018 PISA test scores and rankings across varying levels of government
  spending on education among the ten highest-GDP producing economies of the world. We found
  that government spending per student, as well as the rate of enrollment, is greater for tertiary and
  secondary levels than the primary level, and that greater government spending does not translate into better academic performance.</p></div>
