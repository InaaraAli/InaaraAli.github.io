description: "<h4>About</h4><p>This project examines the relationship between COVID-19
  case rates and the United States’ election outcomes from 2016 and 2020 at the state
  level. The goal was to discover unique insights among political group victory (Democrat
  and Republican) and COVID-19 cases. \n</p><h4>Data sources</h4><p>Given the CDC's
  important role during the COVID-19 pandemic, we were interested in using CDC's data
  for our project. We used the data set’s variables of states, case rates per 100
  thousand people, and total number of cases as of November 11th 2020. Since 2020
  was also the year of the general election, we wanted to explore the relationship
  between voting patterns and COVID-19 prevalence in states. Therefore, we created
  an additional dataset using data from the New York Times dated on November 11th
  that detailed voting percentages across party lines for the 2020 presidential election.
  We also used an external dataset that contained voting percentages for Democrats
  and Republicans in the 2016 presidential election. \n</p>"
